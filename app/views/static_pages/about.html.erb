<p>
    The <a href="http://relentlesshack.sdf.org"><em>SDF Cluster Relentlesshack Page</a> has been around
    for probably like a month or so. IDK, it's not that serious. Go there to check out my tex file work
    that some dude at work won't appreciate in the least bit. To be fair LaTeX sucks for sharepoint 
    authoring so there's that. What's the moral of the story? Start with Showdown.js from the get-go.
